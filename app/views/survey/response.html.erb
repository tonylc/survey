<h2>Using the Enterprising Family Sustainability Index to Develop Your Family</h2>

<h3>What do your scores mean?</h3>
<p>Now that you have completed the <strong>Enterprising Family Sustainability Index</strong>, you can use what you have learned to initiate dialogue and discussion in your family. You will either have filled out the Index on your own or have done so with several members of your family. If you have completed it alone, you still have the opportunity for other family members to sign in later to take the Index. We strongly suggest that the Index be completed by each family member, and that there be a family discussion of what to do.</p>
<p>There are no right or wrong answers. You will discover that some family members see the family differently from others, and this can lead to a healthy discussion of what these differences mean, instead of arguing about who is right or wrong. The intention of this Index is to help you discover things about your family, and to open up a dialogue, not to offer definitive information about what your family should or should not be doing.</p>
<p>The best way to use the results from the Index is to bring the members of your family together for a conversation about these results. All the dimensions involve practices that the family undertakes as a group, so you will want to talk to others in your family about their perceptions of what you do now and what you want to do in the future. As a family, you can go through the practices in each dimension and develop an <strong>Action Plan</strong> for which ones are most important for the family to focus on in the coming year.</p>
<p>We have a working paper that we can send you on how to put the Index to use in your family. Also, our book <strong>Stewardship of Your Family Enterprise</strong> can guide you on how to set up a family discussion, how to do family strategic planning for the future, and how to initiate family practices in each dimension of the Index.  We hope you will use this Index as a tool to guide you in where to focus your reading, to begin working with your family to develop their capacity to sustain your family legacy and success for future generations.</p>
